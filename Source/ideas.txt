//New modules\\
* Packet inspection of incoming packets
* Opening .exe and inspecting contents - checks for suspicious code inside .exe files, like obfuscation
* Anti-phishing website module - prevents user from connecting to malicious site by terminating that connection
* MITM detector - does not allow user to browse until they get rid of MITM
* Sneaky/side download prevention - websites will not download anything without your knowledge!
* Hash comparer - checks for malware from malware database, will also use fuzzy hashes
* Hash maker - if you find new malware, you will be able to get its hash and send the hash to me so that it will be detected in the future
* Rootkit scanner - will check for rootkits
* .cfg files that saves user preferences FOR EVERY SCRIPT
* Proxy - routes traffic through another OS, preferably a new one. The proxy will detect any malicious traffic that you might exhibit.
* Potentially Unwanted Program and Bloatware detection (also via hashes and fuzzy hashes)
* Behaviour blocker - blocks common malware behaviours like opening ports
* Installer for Sentinel XP - will have "no antivirus" popup removal and GUID generation built-in
* Instruction manual - will be a .pdf outlining file structure and different quirks of the modules
* Directory Protector - protects specified directories (or entire disk) from being accessed/modified by any process except this one (will require custom kernel module)
* Get Update - checks this repo for new updates, will probably have a way of updating automatically (without user manually moving files)
* Install Check - inspired by Hitman Pro, checks what an installer does/modifies
* Quarantine - all network connections closed, all non-system processes closed, user given OS state report, no files modified without user permission
* Molly the Mole - a character inspired by Clippy, will be a primitive, hard-coded chatbot with a primitive weight system
* Executable warning - for example, a common attack is making a filename like this: "IamNotMalware.mp4[Braille Characters - ammount to a large space].exe". If the file has an extention like this, the user will get warned that this is an executable
* Activity Wipe - similar to the tool from Glarysoft that clears activity-related metadata
* Temp file clearance (related to the one above)
* Pinpoint Uninstaller - will help with uninstalling programs like AVG, which tend to leave some spyware behind if you use their native uninstaller. Similar to the tool by Glarysoft

//Tweaks\\
* GUI version (maybe)
* Light Mode and Dark Mode for GUI (maybe, depends on GUI)
* Intrusive Cookie Clearance (maybe, browser-related)
* Vigilant Mode - you have to accept Windows processes manually
* "Unknown Publisher" warning will be tweaked
* Anti Lockout - no popup will force you to act - just close it and continue doing whatever you were doing
* Clipboard Protector - protects from clipboard stealers

///Done\\\
* Menu module to operate on other modules - the first thing made on this project, will show Security Tip of the Day
* File Monitor - shows files being modified, accessed and created, alerts if that happens in system
* Windows Integrity Check - checks for missing/corrupted .dlls
* "No antivirus" pop-up remover script (no support for GUID yet)
* RAM checker - shows RAM used by Windows and non-Windows processes
* Metadata wiper - wipes metadata from .jpg and .txt files
* Connection Console - checks which processes are trying to "call home" (reaching out to servers, especially if that is unwanted)
* Fortifier Module - makes your machine invulnreable from selected XP exploits (for example via closing vulnreable and obsolete ports)

///Expansion ideas\\\
* The antivirus will remove the "No antivirus" pop-up only if it has unique GUID for user, therefore a GUID generator will be needed
* Menu module will show Security Tip of the Day
* Menu will have presets that each run specified modules (each specified by user)
* File monitor will show and block malicious processes (will require custom kernel module)
* Make Metadata Wiper clean more files of metadata
* Add connection whitelist/blacklist to Connection Console
* Fortifier will prevent more exploits
* Menu - will run selected program templates

//Bugs\\
* Fix A00001 error for Storage Check
* Fix A00002 error for Metadata Wiper
* Fix A00003 error for Windows Integrity Check

//Fixed bugs\\

///Finished expansion ideas\\\
* Windows Integrity Check checks for A LOT MORE system files missing. Moreover, you can create a list of files to check for yourself.
* Windows Integrity Check allows for presets. For example, if you modified your XP using nLite, you will be able to skip the warnings for components that you removed.
* Windows Integrity Check will play success.wav when integrity is above 95%
* Windows Integrity Check automatically creates system_state.conf and puts it into "settings" folder when none is present
* Fortifier saves enabled and disabled safety measures to settings/fortifier.conf
